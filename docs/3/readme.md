# 3. Scoring Severity of Adjudicated Relapses

If a patient has experienced an adjudicated and localized relapse, the final step in the **_Relapse Navigator_** process is determination of relapse severity. In a typical treatment protocol, subjects are directed to report new symptoms as soon as possible and present for examination within 1-3 days. Assessments of severity should be done using clinical data collected for relapse adjudication despite the fact that the timing of the examination may not reflect the true relapse nadir. Clinical events that worsen after an initial negative adjudication and are re-adjudicated will have a severity assessment if relapse is confirmed at the second examination. Relapse recovery may also be an endpoint of interest, but it reflects factors such as intrinsic relapse severity, timing of and responsiveness to treatment, and other potential confounders.

Regardless of relapse type, severity is classified as mild, moderate, or severe based on degree of change when comparing the Baseline to the Relapse examinations. This ordinal scale is preferred for simplicity, inter-module consistency, and to enhance inter-rater reliability. Overall relapse severity is determined by the additive effects of confirmed clinical change for each relevant module. If a relapse involves only one module, the severity of clinical change calculated for that module also reflects the overall relapse severity. For a confirmed multifocal relapse, the overall relapse severity is determined based upon the number and severity of the individual module severity scores, as follows:

## Table 1: Determination of Overall Relapse Severity

| **Overall Relapse Severity** | **Number of Anatomic Modules (Relapse Sites) Involved and Associated Severity** |
| --- | --- |
| **Mild** | Mild relapse in 1 module |
| **Moderate** | Moderate relapse in 1 module and no other site affected or other site(s) mild **OR** Mild relapse in 2 or more modules |
| **Severe** | Severe relapse in 1 module **OR** Moderate relapse in 2 or more modules |
