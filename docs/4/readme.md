# 4. Comparison of the Relapse Navigator with Other Instruments

**Table 2. Comparison of Instruments to Evaluate Relapse Adjudication**

| **Parameter** | **EDSS/FS** | **Relapse Navigator** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Targeted disease** | Multiple sclerosis | NMOSD |
| **Purpose** | Summary of functional status | Determination whether a neurologic event is a true relapse; confirm localization; assess severity |
| **Organization** | Functional systems (visual, pyramidal, sensory, cerebellar, bladder/bowel, brainstem, cerebral) | Neuroanatomic sites of relapse (spinal cord, optic nerve, area postrema, brainstem, brain) |
| **Rating hierarchy** | Primarily function oriented | Primarily exam oriented (sensitive to findings that have changed) |
| **Evaluation** | Clinical only | Clinical or clinical supplemented by MRI |
| **Limitations for relapse adjudication** | Responsiveness reduced by baseline deficits not affected by new event (e.g. visual FS can only increase by 1 point if blind in contralateral eye) | Focused only on findings that change; assessment not altered by findings that do not change/residual findings of previous relapses |
| **Brain assessment** | Crude cerebral score; does not assess hypothalamic dysfunction, seizure, eating disorders and other NMOSD-related syndromes | Assessment of NMO-specific relapses such as area postrema syndrome, hypothalamic dysfunction |
